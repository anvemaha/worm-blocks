# TODO
- Fix GPU usage issue properly and not with RTSS

# 11.06.2020
- Visual Studio, Otter, ComTest setup done
- MIT license
- Otter\Utility\Debugger.cs line 128 changed Key.Tilde -> Key.Home so I can use the Otter in-game debug console (finnish keyboard layout doesn't really have a tilde)
- Known issue: nearly 100% GPU usage, as a temp fix I'll limit the framerate with RTSS
