# TODO
- Fix GPU usage issue properly and not with RTSS

# 14.06.2020
- Basic generic entity pooling done

# 12.06.2020
- Basic WormGame done
- Different scenes are in different files 
- Began work on AreaGame (Grid) and Pooling
    - **NOTE:** The names I pick for things seem to often overlap with some premade Otter stuff. Probably if I just wanted to make a game I'd have to do much less work, but the point is not to learn Otter but rather learn keyboard shortcuts (edge, windows, visual studio), git commands / github, markdown, windows terminal and get some practise in OOP.

# 11.06.2020
- Visual Studio, Otter, ComTest setup done
- MIT license
- Otter\Utility\Debugger.cs line 128 changed Key.Tilde -> Key.Home so I can use the Otter in-game debug console (finnish keyboards don't really have a tilde)
- Known issue: nearly 100% GPU usage, as a temp fix I'll limit the framerate with RTSS
