# Controller mapping
- Right now I'll document here how otter joystick things map to controller
- Later on this file will be updated with the actual controls
    - I might merge this to README.md

## Axises
negative is either left or up and values are between (-100, 100)
- Left Stick
    - Horizontal:   X
    - Vertical:     Y
- Right Stick
    - Horizontal:   U
    - Vertical:     V
- D-PAD
    - Horizontal:   PovX
    - Vertical:     PovY
- Triggers share Z, right one has negative values (wtf?)

## Buttons
- A = 0
- B = 1
- X = 2
- Y = 3
- LB = 4
- RB = 5
- BACK  = 6
- START = 7
- L3 = 8
